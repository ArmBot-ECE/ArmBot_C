# Branch/Collaboration

Code must implemented in specific git branches. Then create a **Pull Request** pointing to **Master**.

### Create and switch branch

Change branch using:

`$ git checkout <existing_branch>`

Create a new branch and directly switch to it:

`$ git checkout -b <new_branch>`

Push the branch on github:

`$ git push origin <name_of_your_new_branch>`
